# Protocol-agnostic and Data-free Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Models in RF Fingerprinting
Our paper was just accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2025, here is the code example of our paper. In our paper, we pre-define a set of triggers and output representations to inject backdoors into pre-trained models without any knowledge of downstream data.

ORACLE: https://www.genesys-lab.org/oracle

WiSig: https://cores.ee.ucla.edu/downloads/datasets/wisig/

CORES: https://cores.ee.ucla.edu/downloads/datasets/rf-fingerprinting-dataset/

## Self-Supervised Learning Methods
In this paper, we mainly evaluate two popular methods (generative and contrastive) from the below repositories:

LIMU-BERT: https://github.com/dapowan/LIMU-BERT-Public

CL-HAR: https://github.com/Tian0426/CL-HAR 

Some of the modeling codes in our paper are adopted from these two repositories.
